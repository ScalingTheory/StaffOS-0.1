You are a senior DevOps + Full-Stack engineer.
I am working on an organization GitHub repository and need this project prepared for professional production deployment.

📌 PROJECT CONTEXT

GitHub Org Repo: ScalingTheory/StaffOS-0.1

Branch strategy:

main → Production (LIVE)

dev → Development / staging

Developers actively work on dev

main must remain stable and power the live website

🚀 DEPLOYMENT STACK (MANDATORY)

Frontend → Vercel

Backend → Render

Database → Neon (PostgreSQL)

🎯 GOALS

Prepare the codebase so it is ready to deploy on:

Vercel (frontend)

Render (backend)

Ensure dev and prod environments are completely isolated

Separate backend services

Separate Neon databases

Ensure no developer work on dev can disturb the live site

Provide clear commands and steps for:

Local development

Dev deployment

Production deployment

🔐 ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

Use environment variables only (no secrets in code)

Support:

NODE_ENV=development

NODE_ENV=production

Backend must read:

DATABASE_URL

Frontend must read:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

🧱 WHAT YOU MUST DO

Analyze the repository structure and identify:

Frontend location

Backend location

Verify and fix:

build scripts

start scripts

production compatibility

Prepare:

Render build & start commands

Vercel deployment compatibility

Ensure:

Dev backend connects only to Neon DEV DB

Prod backend connects only to Neon PROD DB

📤 REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

You must respond with ONLY the following sections:

1. Repository Structure Summary

(frontend path, backend path)

2. Environment Variables

Local

Dev (Render)

Production (Render + Vercel)

3. Backend Deployment (Render)

Dev service setup

Prod service setup

Exact build & start commands

4. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

Production branch config

Preview / dev config

5. Git Workflow Rules

Daily developer workflow

Release workflow (dev → main)

6. Validation Checklist

(Steps to confirm live site is safe)

⚠️ STRICT RULES

Do NOT suggest force push

Do NOT deploy production from dev

Do NOT mix dev and prod databases

Assume this is a real production system with live users

Think carefully and prepare the project like a real company deployment.
